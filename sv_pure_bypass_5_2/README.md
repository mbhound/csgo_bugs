## sv\_pure bypass \#5.2 (Linux only)

Official Valve servers, and most community servers, run with `sv_pure 1`. This causes the client to send CRC32 & MD5 hashes of the files defined in `pure_server_whitelist.txt` to the server. The server then matches the hashes and kicks the player if there is a mismatch.

It seems that this is **still!** implemented poorly and for some `pak01_###.vpk` files it's possible to bypass this check.

### Prerequisites

1. Download this [`pak01_008.vpk`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18keujp9OXI9L5mdv13dssTAhh4t_maJm/view?usp=sharing) or generate it using the instructions below.
2. Rename it to `pak01_008.vpk.wh` and place inside the `csgo` folder.
3. Run `./prepare.sh`

### Steps (I method)

**Note**: You can get kicked while being in-game, although there is a chance that you can keep playing indefinitely.

1. Run `./disable_wallhack.sh`
2. Switch shader settings to high / low.
3. Join any server.
4. Run `./enable_wallhack.sh`.
5. Switch shader settings to high / low.
6. Profit! VAC-proof wallhack.

### Steps (II method)

**Note**: For this method to work you need to place [`video.txt`](video.txt) inside `~/.local/share/Steam/userdata/[steam_id]/730/local/cfg`.

**Note**: If you rejoin the server and aren't kicked immediately, you can keep playing indefinitely.

1. Run `./disable_wallhack.sh`
2. Switch shader settings to high / low.
3. Join any server.
4. Disconnect.
5. Run `./enable_wallhack.sh`.
6. Switch shader settings to high / low.
7. Reconnect.
8. Profit! VAC-proof wallhack.

#### Generating the `pak01_008.vpk` with wallhacks

It's pretty simple. You just need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) to be able to run the script. It will generate `pak01_008.vpk.wh`. It replaces VMT keys like `$ambientreflectionboost` with `$ignorez 1` and keeps the file size the same.

1. Copy the `generateWallhack.js` file to `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo`.
2. Run `node generateWallhack.js`.
